This repository demonstrates a common Node.js issue: server unresponsiveness caused by a long-running synchronous operation that blocks the event loop. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using asynchronous operations to avoid blocking.  This is a crucial concept for building scalable and responsive Node.js applications.
